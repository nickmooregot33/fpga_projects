HARDWARE PROJECTS by Nick Moore
---------------------------
This is the repository where I manage my personal fpga and other hardware projects.  At the moment, the only project in development is the NES project (in the NES folder), but I will soon be beginning ECE 445 Senior Design, and I expect to use this repository for that as well, whether or not there is an fpga involved.

Project List

NES -- This is a project currently in research and development.  The project can also be found in the repository fpga_nes by the github user NESBoy395, of which I am an administrator/contributor.  The project currently is a clone of the cc65 compiler repository on github and of the nes_fpga project by github user Strigeus.  My partner and I are currently looking at whether other options for 2A03 and 2C02 verilog modules will be sufficient to take the project further or whether we will need to start developing our own files for the 2 chips.  Once we have an adequately functioning model for the CPU and PPU we will move on to developing an actual hardware project.  This will require eagle files, a complete parts list, and a means for soldering the components on the pcb and programming the components.  We will be updating the project when we move forward.
